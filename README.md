# kmailMessageDarkMode

**This project [has moved](https://github.com/ksandom/colouredWeb/tree/master/apps/kmail) to be included in the colouredWeb project**

Dark mode (themeS) for recieved messages in KMail.

KMail already does a pretty good job at re-colouring HTML emails to the system theme. But misses a lot of third-party email. This fixes that, and the miss-matches when only one of the background or foreground are set.
